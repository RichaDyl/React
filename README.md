# Your first front-end framework: React

- Mode: `solo`
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `3 days`

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this 5-day challenge you will:

- be able to create a new React application
- be able to "think in React"
- be able to use basic hooks for managing state and reactivity
- be able to organize your app in components

## Your mission

This time the task is simple: you will build a small Todo application that lives in your browser, and saves todos even after restarting the browser.

## Useful resources

React introduces a few uncommon concepts that can be difficult to understand at first. Here is a list of useful resources you can refer to - before, during, and after this exercise.

#### Official Documentation

It's well written and made available in many languages.

- Main concepts, starting with the famous "Hello world" example: https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html
- "Thinking in React": https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html
- If you prefer to learn by doing, you can follow the introductory tutorial: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

Note: the official documentation is still based on "class components", even though the recommended way forward is "function components". You will understand better what that means during this exercise. Just know that, unfortunately, the official docs describe an old way of working. They will soon release the updated docs, but we don't know when.

#### YouTube

There is a TON of React material on YouTube. Choose your own flavor, but make sure that you watch videos that were released in the last year or so.

One suggestion, very relevant to this exercise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY

_Side note: a couple of years ago React went from using mainly "class" based components to mainly "functional" components. Any tutorial that focuses on functional components, and special functions called "hooks" is up to date. Don't waste time on class components, they are the old way._

#### Online Course

Again, there are a TON of courses out there. The same rule applies: make sure they are recent, and they use functional components and hooks.

A good, free, course: https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react

#### Blogs

Sometimes you will find a good explanation for a specific feature or problem in blogs. These are two blogs that always deliver high-quality content:

- https://kentcdodds.com/blog/
- https://www.robinwieruch.de/blog
- https://overreacted.io/

## Deliverables

1. Publish the source code on your GitHub repository
2. Deploy the project

## Good luck!
